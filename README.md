### Welcome ðŸ‘‹
Currently I work at Cartesi as Project Manager.

My previous work was at Tecgraf/PUC-Rio as Team Leader for the Distributed SystemÂ´s Group.

I love to read about software development methodologies, best practices and principles for software development, software architecture, culture and processes for software development and DevOps.
